Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial problems across various domains. 
Numerous solvers and tools have been developed in this area. 
However, their interoperability is often limited.
TOOTAtIs (TOOlset for consTrAint programmIng) presents a suite of tools for constraint programming based on [Universe
library](/universe) that offers a unified API for interacting with different solvers of various programming languages.
